## Heyyo! Welcome. I'm Kal.

Thanks for coming here, it is an honour for me to waste your time!
So...I'm a Software Engineering student, kinda programming heavy, mainly focusing on developing backend systems. Yup, this field is quite stressful but rewarding, you can't disagree with that. Despite the stressfulness (sobbing), I do enjoy on creating :

⚡ AI Chatbots
⚡ Data Pipeline & Analysis
⚡ NLP Configuration
⚡ Python Backend Systems

 If you want to have a fun conversation, discussion, or collaboration on these topics, you know who to find. I guess that sums up the relevant information of myself....and yea, if you wonder, I will NOT fix your computer!
